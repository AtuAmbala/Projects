# Project Title: Force Plates Analysis

## Description
This project involves the analysis of force plate data. Force plates are devices used to measure the ground reaction forces generated by a body standing on or moving across them. The data collected from these plates can be used in various fields such as biomechanics, sports science, and clinical research to understand the dynamics of movement and balance.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use this project, open the `forceplates-output-modified.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in sequence. The notebook includes the following sections:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Data visualization
- Statistical analysis
- Output and results interpretation

## Requirements
The project requires the following Python packages:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
